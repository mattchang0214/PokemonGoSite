## Description
Pokémon Go is an immensely popular augmented reality mobile game that was launched in 2016. Although Pokémon Go is more than two years removed from the peak of its popularity, the game still boasts millions of daily active users worldwide. An important mechanic of the game is the interactions between players in events such as raids, gym battles, and trades. However, there is currently no dedicated service for organizing players that share similar interests — individual players have a hard time finding other players to take part in group events. Our website aims to facilitate the formation of player groups that share a common goal by giving them a platform to connect with each other. It allows users to advertise group events they intend to take part in and join parties with common interests. Users can also share locations and times of appearance of rare Pokémon. All this information, as well as locations of nearby players, will also be available on a map on the website.
